Visualizing the first 1000 Defective Ids and first 1000 Non-Defective Ids using [IBM System G](http://systemg.research.ibm.com/) and their movements across the production lines to develop useful insights about the data.


Import Node.csv and Edge.csv to respective graphs for visualization:

Graph -- Negative:

Visualizing the nodes that first 1000 Defective Ids visit to. There is an edge between every adjacent stations.

[1] Commands for visualizing the graph

[gremlin g=CreateGraph.openGraph("sgtrans","negative")]
[get_num_vertices --graph negative]
[print_all --graph negative]

>>number of nodes: 119
>>number of edges: 407

[2] Command to get the stations that are have more Ids coming into them
analytic_get_top_vertices_by_prop --graph negative --prop analytic_degree_in --topnum 10

[3] Command to get the stations that have the maximum number of Ids coming out of them
analytic_get_top_vertices_by_prop --graph negative --prop analytic_degree_out --topnum 10


Graph -- Positive

Visualizing the nodes that first 1000 Non-Defective Ids visit to. There is an edge between every adjacent stations.

[1] Commands for visualizing the graph
[gremlin g=CreateGraph.openGraph("sgtrans","positive")]
[get_num_vertices --graph positive]

[2] Command to get the stations that are have more Ids coming into them
